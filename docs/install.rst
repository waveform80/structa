Installation
============

At present structa is still very much alpha-quality and isn't packaged anywhere
but PyPI, so installation should be done via pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip3 install structa

If you wish to use dependencies from your package manager rather than pip you
can do so like so:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo apt install python3-setuptools python3-lxml python3-chardet \
        python3-humanize python3-blessings python3-dateutil

Upgrade structa via pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip3 install --upgrade structa

And removal can be done like so:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip3 uninstall structa
