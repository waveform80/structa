.. warning::

    Big fat "unfinished" warning: structa is still very much incomplete at this
    time and there's plenty of rough edges (like not showing CSV column
    titles).

    If you run into unfinished stuff, do check the `issues`_ first as I may
    have a ticket for that already. If you run into genuinely "implemented but
    broken" stuff, please do file an issue; it's these things I'm most
    interested in at this stage.

Getting the most out of structa is part science, part art. The science part is
understanding how structa works and what knobs it has to twiddle. The art bit
is figuring out what to twiddle them to.

Let's start with a simple example. The UK's ONS (Office of National Statistics)
provides a nice pile of simple data to get started with. Have a look at the
`Births, Deaths and Marriages`_ section
