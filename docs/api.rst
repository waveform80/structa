API Reference
=============

In addition to being a utility, structa can also be used as an API from Python
(either in a script, or just at the console).

The primary class of interest will generally be
:class:`~structa.analyzer.Analyzer` in the :mod:`structa.analyzer` module, but
it is important to understand the various classes in the :mod:`structa.types`
module to interpret the output of the analyzer.
